### Explanation of Array 
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets

Example 
```
{
  String[] cars;
}
```
### Task-1 explaination
sorts an array of integers using the Bubble Sort 


Input: Reads 4 integer values from the user and stores them in an array.


Sorting: Uses Bubble Sort to sort the array in ascending order by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order.


Output: Prints the sorted array elements.

### Task-2 explaination
 sorts an array of 10 integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm and prints the array after each swap.

### Task-3 explaination
ircular queue, a type of data structure that allows elements to be added (enqueued) and removed (dequeued) in a circular manner.

### Task-4 explaination
 sorting an array of bank account numbers and their corresponding balances using three different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
